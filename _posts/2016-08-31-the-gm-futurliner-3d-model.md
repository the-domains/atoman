# THE GM FUTURLINER 3D MODEL
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e64b3c99-156f-4d4f-b5c0-10f203adea5c.jpg)

Some time ago I've found on the web an history about the restoration of an old '**50 GM show truck**, called Futurliner...

I have been surprised by the shape of this incredible **truck** and I've decided to make a **3D model**. The **blueprint** founded over the net was not good, not enough details for me but a decent starter point at least for proportion. Therefore I've started from the shooting of restoration, this process have asked me a lot of time but a good 3D model of Futurliner was born. I think that some projects need to be shared and the **Futurliner** is one of this.
