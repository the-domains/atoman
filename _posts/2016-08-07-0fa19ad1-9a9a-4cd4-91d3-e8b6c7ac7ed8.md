# LA CENTRALE ELETTRICA 1919 - 3D RECONSTRUCTION

**Antonio Sant'Elia** was a great Italian architect, writer of [architectural futurist manifest][0] (1914). I'm ever be fascinated by his works...

and after many year of "regular" architectural rendering I've decided to try to reconstruct one of his master works, **The Electric Plan (La Centrale elettrica 1919)**.

I've applied a 3D tracking technique to the unique image produced by the Master, a very beautiful drawing that you can find over the web or following the link at the bottom of this article.

My goal was to reply the atmospher of the original work and try to extend and detail the model, like a modern **architectural project**.

Some time ago I was been contacted by the university of architecture **Suor Orsola Benincasa of Naples**, they have found my image over the web and asked me the permission to use it for the anniversary of futurism, 100 years.
